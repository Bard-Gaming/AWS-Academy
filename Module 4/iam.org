** Users
Users are people who are part of the development
of your service.

*** Types of Access
An admin can choose the way users are allowed to
log into their accounts. These possible ways are:
- Programmatic Access
- AWS Management Console

Depending on the administrator's choice, the users
will be able to log into their accounts with one
or more of these ways (both are possible).

*** Authentication
How users authenticate is also determined by the
administrator. The possible authentication methods
are as follows:

**** Programmatic Access
- Access key ID
- Secret access key

**** AWS Management Console
- 12-digit Account ID or alias
- IAM Username
- IAM Password
- Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)


** Groups
Groups are, as the name suggests, groupings of users.
This allows administrators to provide permission policies
to groups of people, instead of having to manually apply
a policy to many users.


** Policies
Policies determine what permissions or restrictions
a User, User Group, or Role has.
Implicitely, policies have *no permissions*, and *all
permissions are explicit*.

The following diagram describes this best:

** Roles
Roles are similar to users in that they are IAM entities
which are attributed policies. The key difference, is that
roles grant temporary access to specific AWS resources.

This means, for instance, that you can create an EC2 instance
with an IAM role that grants it access to read into an S3 bucket.
This would allow the EC2 instance to easily read the storage bucket,
without requiring a secret key or anything of the sort.
