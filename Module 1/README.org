** Descriptive
This module is a general overview over what
the Cloud and its many services are.

** Overview
This module serves as an introduction, and is
thus relatively simple and easy to understand.
As such, the documentation here isn't very extensive,
as, quite frankly, that would be a waste of time.

** Sections
- [[./benefits.org][The 6 Benefits of the Cloud]]
- [[./services.org][AWS Services]]
