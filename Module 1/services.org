** Categories
[[./images/AWS Service Categories.png]]

These categories are used in this documentation to
make it easier for you to look up specific services.



** Storage
Database / Data storage services.

*** S3
"Simply Storage Service", i.e. the service
you use when you want simple, static pages.

*** RDS
"Relational Database Service", i.e. the service
you use when you want a DB in the SQL family.

*** DynamoDB
Same as RDS except that it uses NoSQL, meaning
this isn't a relational database.

*** Redshift
Highly scalable service, specifically made
for website analytics.



** Compute
Services which allow you to process information.

*** EC2
Main service for backend control / implementation.
You might also want to look into [[../Module 2/billing.org#Pricing][Reserved Instances for EC2]].

*** Lambda
For specific operations that should be run
only at specific times (not all the time).



** Networking / Routing
Services that are used to do the networking
required to run a web service.

*** Amazon VPC
"Virtual Private Cloud" - full control
over your service's networking. This includes
- Physical Placement
- Securing the connections
- Choosing IP range

*** Amazon CloudFront
Amazon CloudFront is the service to reduce
latency across [[../Module 3/regions.org][Availability Zones]], using
a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
This is done by caching the relevant content
in the specified regions, and then serving the
cached content to the user, which skips the
length step of fetching the content from the
server.



** Management
Services that allow you to manage your web
service more easily.

*** Organisations
See [[../Module 2/organisations.org][Organisations]] for more info.
(And yes, they talked about this service in
particular separately)



** Security
Services that prevent those gnarly network
pirates from attack your services! Yarr!

*** IAM
"Identity and Access Management" - guardrails,
access management, whatever. It's a login manager
from what I can tell.
