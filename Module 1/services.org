** Foreword
The notes I took on the different notes here are filled
in with more knowledge than what is required for the
first module. The idea is that you can glance over the
different services, without going into detail. The
modules that come after this one will link back to this
if required.
This might seem a bit weird at first, but AWS Services
are general enough to be referenced in most modules,
so to avoid repetition, I made this general services
document.



** Categories
[[./images/AWS Service Categories.png]]

These categories are used in this documentation to
make it easier for you to look up specific services.



** Compute
Services which allow you to process information.

*** EC2
The "Elastic Compute Cloud" service allows you to have
VM instances to do virtually anything you want with.
This means you can run your own programs / applications
on the Cloud.

You might also want to look into [[../Module 2/billing.org#Pricing][Reserved Instances for EC2]].

The *EC2 Auto Scale* service allows you to scale out your
application, meaning that new instances will be automatically
started if the other instances are taking too long / aren't
responding. This allows you to automatically scale your
application with user demand.

*** Lambda
For specific operations that should be run
only at specific times (not all the time).

*** ECS
The "Elastic Container Service" is a service that
allows you to deploy, manage, and scale containers
(think of Docker but as a Cloud service).



** Storage
Database / Data storage services.

*** EBS
"Elastic Block Store" is a service that
mimicks gives the virtual server a disk,
like /dev/vda or /dev/vdb.
EBS is useful when you need high performance
storage on a single EC2 instance.

*** EFS
"Elastic File System" is a service that
provides a typical file system (meaning one
you are most likely accustomed to).
It is highly performant, but less so than
EBS. This, however, is an acceptable tradeoff,
seeing as you get the ability to share a single
file system across multiple EC2 instances.

*** S3
"Simple Storage Service" is a service similar
to EFS, except that it has better availability,
it's better at archiving data in general, and
it supports displaying HTML pages, which is why
it's widely used to host static HTML websites
which don't require any computation from EC2
or other compute services.

/Note: S3 glacier is the same, except that it/
/allows you to store backup data for cheaper,/
/but which requires you to wait for longer for/
/retrieval./

*** RDS
"Relational Database Service", i.e. the service
you use when you want a DB in the SQL family.

*** DynamoDB
Same as RDS except that it uses NoSQL, meaning
this isn't a relational database.

*** Redshift
Highly scalable service, specifically made
for website analytics.



** Networking / Routing
Services that are used to do the networking
required to run a web service.

*** Amazon VPC
"Virtual Private Cloud" - full control
over your service's networking. This includes
- Physical Placement
- Securing the connections
- Choosing IP range

*** Amazon CloudFront
Amazon CloudFront is the service to reduce
latency across [[../Module 3/regions.org][Availability Zones]], using
a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
This is done by caching the relevant content
in the specified regions, and then serving the
cached content to the user, which skips the
length step of fetching the content from the
server.



** Management
Services that allow you to manage your web
service more easily.

*** Organisations
See [[../Module 2/organisations.org][Organisations]] for more info.
(And yes, they talked about this service in
particular separately)



** Security
Services that prevent those gnarly network
pirates from attack your services! Yarr!

*** IAM
"Identity and Access Management" - guardrails,
access management, whatever. It's a login manager
from what I can tell.
