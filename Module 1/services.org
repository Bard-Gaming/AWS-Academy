* Storage
Database / Data storage services.

** S3
"Simply Storage Service", i.e. the service
you use when you want simple, static pages.

** RDS
"Relational Database Service", i.e. the service
you use when you want a DB in the SQL family.

** DynamoDB
Same as RDS except that it uses NoSQL, meaning
this isn't a relational database.

** Redshift
Highly scalable service, specifically made
for website analytics.



* Compute
Services which allow you to process information.

** EC2
Main service for backend implementation

** Lambda
For specific operations that should be run
only at specific times (not all the time).


* Networking / Routing
Services that are used to do the networking
required to run a web service.

** Amazon VPC
"Virtual Private Cloud" - full control
over your service's networking. This includes
- Physical Placement
- Securing the connections
- Choosing IP range


* Management
** Organisations
See [[../Module 2/organisations.org][Organisations]] for more info.
(And yes, they talked about this service in
particular separately)


* Security
Services that prevent those gnarly network
pirates from attack your services! Yarr!

** IAM
"Identity and Access Management" - guardrails,
access management, whatever. It's a login manager
from what I can tell.
