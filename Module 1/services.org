[!NOTE]
All services covered here may or may not be
useful for the first module. It is not imperative
that you learn all of these before completing the
first module, but nevertheless all services mentioned
here are /required/ for the official examination.

* Categories
[[./images/AWS Service Categories.png]]

These categories are used in this documentation to
make it easier for you to look up specific services.



** Compute
[[./images/AWS Compute Services.png]]

Services which allow you to process information.

*** EC2
The "Elastic Compute Cloud" service allows you to have
VM instances to do virtually anything you want with.
This means you can run your own programs / applications
on the Cloud.

It is important to note that EC2 instances *do not have
persistent data* and *will lose all of their data when
terminated*. To have persistent data, please refer to [[Storage]].

#+begin_quote
[!NOTE]
The temporary data stored in EC2 instances is called the
/EC2 instance store/.

You might also want to look into [[../Module 2/billing.org#Pricing][Reserved Instances for EC2]].

*** EC2 Auto Scale
/Not to be confused with/ AWS Auto Scaleâ€‹/./

The *EC2 Auto Scale* service allows you to scale out your
application, meaning that new instances will be automatically
started if the other instances are taking too long / aren't
responding. This allows you to automatically scale your
application with user demand.

*** Lambda
For specific operations that should be run
only at specific times (not all the time).

*** ECS
The "Elastic Container Service" is a service that
allows you to deploy, manage, and scale containers
(think of Docker but as a Cloud service).



** Storage
[[./images/AWS Storage Services.png]]

Persistent data storage services.

*** EBS
"Elastic Block Store" is a service that
mimicks virtual drives, allowing you to
mount the virtual disk to an existing
[[EC2]] instance.
EBS is useful when you need high performance
storage on a single EC2 instance.

*** S3
"Simple Storage Service" is a service similar
to EFS, except that it has better availability,
it's better at archiving data in general, and
it supports displaying HTML pages, which is why
it's widely used to host static HTML websites
which don't require any computation from EC2
or other compute services.

/Note: S3 glacier and S3 deep glacier are the same,
except that they allow you to store backup data for
/cheaper, but which requires you to wait for longer
/for retrieval./

*** EFS
"Elastic File System" is a service that
provides a typical file system (meaning one
you are most likely accustomed to).
It is highly performant, but less so than
EBS. This, however, is an acceptable tradeoff,
seeing as you get the ability to share a single
file system across multiple EC2 instances.


** Databases
Database services allow you to have large sets of
persistent data in a structured way.
In general, *you should choose NoSQL services (i.e.*
*DynamoDB) over SQL services if you don't require
complex query operations*.

*** RDS
"Relational Database Service", i.e. the service
you use when you want a DB in the SQL family.
You may choose your SQL engine among the many
that are at your disposal.

*** Aurora
Similar to RDS, except that this is more optimized
and is highly scalable. However, it is limited
to MySQL and PostgreSQL. This should be used over
RDS when possible.

*** DynamoDB
Same as RDS except that it uses NoSQL, meaning
this isn't a relational database. If there isn't
a fixed schema for the data you wish to store,
choose this.

*** Redshift
Highly scalable service, specifically made
for website analytics.


** Networking / Routing
Services that are used to do the networking
required to run a web service.

*** Amazon VPC
"Virtual Private Cloud" - full control
over your service's networking. This includes
- Physical Placement
- Securing the connections
- Choosing IP range

*** Amazon CloudFront
Amazon CloudFront is the service to reduce
latency across [[../Module 3/regions.org][Availability Zones]], using
a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
This is done by caching the relevant content
in the specified regions, and then serving the
cached content to the user, which skips the
length step of fetching the content from the
server.



** Management
Services that allow you to manage your web
service on AWS more easily.

*** Organisations
See [[../Module 2/organisations.org][Organisations]] for more info.
(And yes, they talked about this service in
particular separately)



** Security
Services that prevent those gnarly network
pirates from attacking your web service! Yarr!

*** IAM
"Identity and Access Management" - guardrails,
access management, whatever. Basically it's the
service you use when you want to restrict permissions
in your AWS environment. For more info, you should
check out [[../Module 4/iam.org][AWS IAM]].
