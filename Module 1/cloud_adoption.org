** About
The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework is a stepping stone
used to guide businesses into migrating their on-premise
servers onto the cloud.


** Perspectives
The AWS CAF is divided into six core perspectives.
This section covers those.


*** Business
This perspective's priority is to ensure
*IT is aligned with business needs*.

A quote I've seen appear as a question is:
#+begin_quote
Stakeholders from the Business perspective (for
example, business managers, finance managers, budget
owners, and strategy stakeholders) can use the AWS
CAF to create a strong business case for cloud adoption
and prioritize cloud adoption initiatives.
#+end_quote

*** People
This perspective's priority is *training,
staffing, and organizational changes* to
build an agile organization.

An important quote is:
#+begin_quote
Stakeholders from the People perspective (for
example, human resources, staffing, and people
managers) can use the AWS CAF to evaluate
organizational structures and roles, new skill
and process requirements, and identify gaps.
#+end_quote

*** Governance
This perspective's priority is to *align IT
strategy and goals with business strategy and goals*
so the organization can maximize the business value
of its IT investment and minimize business risks.

An important quote is:
#+begin_quote
Stakeholders from the Governance perspective (for
example, the Chief Information Officer or CIO, program
managers, enterprise architects, business analysts,
and portfolio managers) can use the AWS CAF to focus on
the skills and processes that are needed to align IT
strategy and goals with business strategy and goals.
This focus helps the organization maximize the business
value of its IT investment and minimize the business risks.

*** Platform
This perspective's priority is to *understand and
communicate the nature of IT systems and their relationships*.
Another aspect it to be able to *describe the architecture
of the target state environment in detail*.

#+begin_quote
Stakeholders from the Platform perspective (for
example, Chief Technology Officer or CTO, IT
managers, and solutions architects) use a variety
of architectural dimensions and models to understand
and communicate the nature of IT systems and their
relationships. They must be able to describe the
architecture of the target state environment in detail.
The AWS CAF includes principles and patterns for
implementing new solutions on the cloud, and for
migrating on premises workloads to the cloud.
#+end_quote

*** Security
This perspective's priority is to ensure that
*the organization meets its security objectives*.

#+begin_quote
Stakeholders from the Security perspective (for
example, Chief Information Security Officer or
CISO, IT security managers, and IT security analysts)
must ensure that the organization meets security
objectives for visibility, auditability, control,
and agility. Security perspective stakeholders
can use the AWS CAF to structure the selection
and implementation of security controls that
meet the organizationâ€™s needs.
#+end_quote

*** Operations
This perspective's priority is to *define how day-to-day,
quarter-to-quarter, and year-to-year business will be conducted*.

#+begin_quote
Stakeholders from the Operations perspective (for
example, IT operations managers and IT support
managers) define how day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter,
and year-to-year business is conducted. Stakeholders
from the Operations perspective align with and support
the operations  of the business. The AWS CAF helps
these stakeholders define current operating procedures.
It also helps them identify the process changes and
training that are needed to implement successful cloud
adoption.
#+end_quote


** Summary
1. Cloud adoption is not instantaneous for most organizations
  and requires a thoughtful, deliberate strategy and alignment
  across the whole organization.
2. The AWS CAF was created to help organizations develop
  efficient and effective plans for their cloud adoption
  journey.
3. The AWS CAF organizes guidance into six areas of focus,
  called perspectives.
4. Perspectives consist of sets of business or technology
  capabilities that are the responsibility of key stakeholders.
