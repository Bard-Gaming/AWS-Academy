** General Info
*** Data
Data across regions is replicated by the user,
not AWS itself.
This means that if a user creates in account
in London, the data stored for the account isn't
automatically copied over into other regions.


*** Enabling / Disabling Regions
Most regions are enabled by default.
In order to use a region, it needs to be turned on
first in the *AWS Management Console*.


*** Restricted Access
Some regions have restricted access, meaning they
can only communicate between some or no other regions.

For instance, an AWS China Account may only access
the BeiJing and NingXia regions.


*** Region Selection
The following point should be taken into account
when selecting a region:
- Proximity to Customers (though this is quite obvious)
- Legal Requirements (i.e. EU's GDPR)
- AWS Services (not all are available in all regions)
- Cost (may vary between regions) -> determines by availability zones


** Availability Zones
"Availability Zones" are the zones that AWS data centers
cover. These zones are all 100KM apart of one another,
and there is a total of 69 (nice) Availability Zones as
of June 2025 (according to the speaker).

These data centers have around 50 000 to 80 000 physical
servers.

/Note: It is up to the user to choose which availability zones/
/will be used, and it is also up to the user to replicate data/
/across availability zones, if desired./


** Edge Locations
Edge locations are data centers specialized in serving cached
content to nearby users. These edge locations may be *within or
outside* of availability zones.

To use edge locations (useful when you want to lower latency),
you may use the [[../Module 1/services.org#amazon-cloudFront][Amazon CloudFront]] service.
