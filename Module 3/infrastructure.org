** Elasticity and Scalability
I won't go too much into detail as I'm
sure you're already aware of this, but the
fact that there are upwards of 80K physical
servers per availability zone means that
there is virtually no limit to how much you
can scale your web service, even when restricted
to a single region (= multiple availability zones).

** Fault Tolerance
AWS always has multiple Availability Zones within a region,
meaning that if a data center shuts down for a reason (which
is unlikely given the backup generators and prevention mechanisms
AWS has put up), there are still other data centers to cover the
given region.

To add onto this, minimal human intervention is required, meaning
that users don't have to wait for workers to approve any changes,
as this would mean waiting until there are actual people available
to review everything.
