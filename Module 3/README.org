** Descriptive
This module explains the global infrastructure
AWS employs to make its services accessible
worldwide.

** Overview
AWS uses a global network of data centers to allow
hosting web services anywhere in the world, all whilst
keeping the latency as low as possible for the users.
The regions that are convered by these data centers
are separate to stay within the bounds of the local
laws, but are still highly flexible, meaning web
services can replicate data across regions without
causing latency, thanks to a CDN.
