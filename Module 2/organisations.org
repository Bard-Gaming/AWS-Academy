** Organisations
AWS Organisations is a service allows you to create
groups ("organisations", from hereon "orgs"), which
act as lower-level accounts with specific permissions
and responsabilities.


** Branches
Each branch represents a department or team.
Yeah nothing much to add there, the previous point
explained it pretty well.


** Organisational Units (OUs)
Organisational Units are groups / clusters
of branches. These OUs are used to apply a specific
policy onto multiple branches / orgs.
**There is a limit to the amount of branches an
organisation can have.**

** Service Control Policies (SCP)
Service Control Policies are restrictions
that can be put on [[Organisational Units (OUs)][OUs]] as a way to control
who can do what within an organisation.
*This works in conjunction with IAM policies*,
allowing users to create complex hierarchies.
