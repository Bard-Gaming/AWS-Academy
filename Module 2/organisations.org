* Groups / Organisations
This service allows you to create
groups ("organisations", from hereon "orgs"), which
act as lower-level accounts with specific permissions
and responsabilities.

* Branches
Each branch represents a department or team.
Yeah nothing much to add there, the previous point
explained it pretty well.

* Organisational Units (OUs)
Organisational Units are groups / clusters
of branches. These OUs are used to apply a specific
policy onto multiple branches / orgs.
