*** Structure
This repository is organised into the 10 different modules
that are required to obtain the Cloud Practitioner certificate.

These are:
- [[./Module 1][Module 1: Cloud Concepts]]
- [[./Module 2][Module 2: Cloud Economics and Billing]]
- others yet to come.

All modules have a general overview in their README.
You are free to browse this repository as you please.


*** Credits
Everything here is owned by AWS Academy.
I am merely creating a text support to allow future
cloud practitioners to have an easier time learning.
Enjoy !
